This file contains release notes for the Xilinx LogiCORE IP DDS Compiler v5.0
solution. For the latest core updates, see the product page at:

   <A HREF="http://www.xilinx.com/products/ipcenter/DDS_Compiler.htm">www.xilinx.com/products/ipcenter/DDS_Compiler.htm</A>


2. NEW FEATURES

- ISE 13.4 software support
- ISE 13.3 software support
- ISE 13.2 software support
- Support for Artix-7 with ISE 13.2
- ISE 13.1 software support
- ISE 12.3 software support
- AXI4-Stream interface
- Supports automatic core update from DDS Compiler v4.0, v3.0, v2.1 and v2.0.

   Note: DDS Compiler version 5.0 is not bit-accurate with respect to version 3.0
   and earlier. In particular, first order Taylor Series Correction table entries
   have been optimized to improve overall accuracy. Extended range of DDS with no
   noise shaping may reduce DATA width requirements. The update function will aim
   to adjust Frequency Resolution to maintain the phase width and associated DATA
   width.  Note that this may result in the specified Frequency Resolution parameter
   changing. However, as phase width is maintained, this will not affect
   the actual resolution of frequency or phase values. Also, there have been
   changes to latency, in particular to accommodate the new dynamic phase
   increment and phase offset options. Accumulator Latency has been removed
   and is assumed to be One.

4. RESOLVED ISSUES

  - N/A


5. KNOWN ISSUES

The following are known issues for v5.0 of this core at time of release:

  - TLAST may be incorrectly asserted at power-up or after a reset for the following core configuration:
    Parts Present = DDS (both phase generator and SIN/COS LUT present)
    Channels = 2
    Phase Increment = Fixed
    Phase Offset = None or Fixed
    Output TLAST = Vector Framing

    - Workaround:
      Set M_DATA and/or M_PHASE TUSER setting to "Channel ID" or "User Field and Channel ID" (as appropriate). 
      The LSB of the TUSER output will be asserted to indicate the last (second) channel. 
      This bit may then be passed to downstream modules in place of the TLAST output.
