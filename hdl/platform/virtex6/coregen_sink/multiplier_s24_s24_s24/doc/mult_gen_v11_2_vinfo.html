4. RESOLVED ISSUES

  - N/A


5. KNOWN ISSUES

The following are known issues for v11.2 of this core at time of release:

  - Output bus indices in .ASY file do not match instantiation template bus indices
    when a custom output width is selected.
     - The indices of the P output bus will be P[X:Y] in the .ASY file and P[X-Y:0] in
       the core instantiation template.
     - Affects schematic flow only.
     - Manually editing the .ASY file to correct the bus width can work around this issue.
     - CR456322 and CR435084
     - Answer Record 30807

  - Block Memory resource estimates may be inaccurate for constant-coefficient multipliers
    with large constants and large A input widths (&gt; 35 bits)
     - The map report should be consulted to determine the true block memory count
     - CR469169
     - Answer Record 30810
